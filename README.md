# fract-ol
This project from 42 is about creating a small fractal exploration program. First, you have to know what a fractal is.

# Credits

The understanding of the concept of fractals and the implementation of the program was done with the help of the following resources:
* Mathematical principles, equations, and translation to code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUlVFYJIUNA
* Use of threads to improve performance: https://github.com/GlThibault/Fractol/

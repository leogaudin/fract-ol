## ⚙️ Usage

* **Clone** the repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/leogaudin/fract-ol.git
	```

* To **compile** the program, run the following command

	```bash
	make
	```

* To **execute** the program, use the following command

	```bash
	./fract-ol <fractal>
	```

> Available commands: `mandel`, `julia`, `ship`

### 🕹 Controls

The program supports the following controls:
<table align="center">
  <tr align="center">
    <td><b>Scroll</b></td>
    <td>Zoom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td><b>⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️</b></td>
    <td>Move the view</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td><b>R</b></td>
    <td>Reset the fractal to its initial state</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td><b>C</b></td>
    <td>Shift the color range</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td><b>M</b> and <b>P</b></td>
    <td>Decrease or increase the max iterations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td><b>J</b></td>
    <td>Generate new constants for the Julia fractal</td>
  </tr>
</table>


> 🚀 The lower the  iterations, the faster the program will run.
>
> 🐢 The deeper the zoom, the more iterations are needed to render the fractal, the slower the program.

## 🤔 How to do Fract-ol?

### 🤓 The math behind fractals

Fractals are formed by mathematical suites.

For example, the Julia and Mandelbrot sets are defined by the following suite:

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
$$

Fractals are based on complex numbers (i.e. numbers with a real and imaginary part, like $z = a + bi$).

There is a great video by [DIMENSION CODE](https://www.youtube.com/@DIMENSIONCODE) explaining the concept of fractals and how to generate them here:

|[![Comment Générer des Fractales ? ❄️](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wUlVFYJIUNA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/wUlVFYJIUNA)|
|:-------:|
| **Comment Générer des Fractales ? ❄️** |
| *🇫🇷 French only*|

The video is ≈ 20 minutes long, but the part that we need to get started can be summarised as:

* The $a$ (real) part of the complex number is represented on a x-axis.
* The $b$ (imaginary) part of the complex number is represented on a y-axis.
* This means that the coordinates $(3, 7)$ represent number $z = 3 + 7i$, and that every pixel of a window can be used to represent a complex number.
* Every complex number put into the suite will either:

	* converge to a finite number
	* diverge to infinity.

* The pixels of the window can be colored depending on whether the complex number they represent converges or diverges.

* If we paint every pixel of the window in ![black](https://placehold.co/10x10/000/000.png) if the complex number they represent converges or ![white](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffffff/ffffff.png) if it diverges, we can see it already generates a fractal:

### 👨🏻‍💻 From math to code

1. Setup the MiniLibX library.
	* You can find good resources on how to do this [here](https://qst0.github.io/ft_libgfx/man_mlx.html).
2. Create a window, image and all the necessary things in the MiniLibX.
3. Iterate through every pixel of the window.
	* *See [`draw_fractal`](#draw_fractal)*.
4. For every pixel, calculate the complex number it represents and put it into the suite.
	* *See [`calculate_mandelbrot`](#calculate_mandelbrot) for example*.
5. If the suite diverges, color the pixel in ![white](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffffff/ffffff.png).
6. If the suite converges, color the pixel in ![black](https://placehold.co/10x10/000/000.png).


## 🛠️ Main functions

### `draw_fractal`

```c
int draw_fractal(t_fractal *fractal, char *query, double cx, double cy)
```
As explained before, this function simply iterates through the pixels of the window and calls the appropriate function to draw the fractal.

### `calculate_mandelbrot`

```c
void calculate_mandelbrot(t_fractal *fractal)
```
* The $z$ variables are set to 0, the beginning of the suite.

* The $c$ constants are set to the coordinates of the pixel.

* For performance reasons, we use the `(x * x)` calculation instead of the
`pow(x, 2)` function.

* The suite is iterated until:

	* **The absolute value of z is greater than the system's max values**: the suite will diverge to infinity.

	* **The number of iterations is too high**: the suite will stay stuck in an infinite loop.

* If the the suite diverges, we color it and multiply the color by the number of iterations to make the mathematical depths more clear to the
eye.

***🎉 Fun fact**: the British Standard subtitle color, ![#FCBE11](https://placehold.co/15x15/FCBE11/FCBE11.png) `#FCBE11` gives some pretty cool psychedelic renders when multiplied by the number of iterations*

> `calculate_julia` and `calculate_burning_ship` are very similar to `calculate_mandelbrot`, but with different equations.

	> 💡 Don't use `mlx_pixel_put` like I did at first.
	>
	> It's slow and you can't re-render the canvas.
	>
	> Use `mlx_put_image_to_window` instead.
